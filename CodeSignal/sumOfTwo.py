def sumOfTwo(a, b, v):

    # examples are sorted, but are we going to actually get sorted input?
    # no, input arrays may not be sorted

    # sort the two arrays
    # could we use a similar two pointer strategy?

    # if we're hash tables, what is going in the hash tables?
    # store the elements of one of the arrays in the hash table
    # make a sum of an element from a and an element from b
    # check if they equal v
    # does moving all of the elements from one array into a hash table help us?
    # hash tables help us with lookups
    # loop through each element x in b
    # check if v - x is in the hash table
    # as soon as we see that some v - x is in the table
    # then we've found a pair
    # return true
    # no pair was found, return false

    # alternative strategy that utilizes a hash table

    # can we consider a "easier" problem?
    # if we only had a single array and had to find two values in it
    # that summed up to v, how would we do that?

    # sort the input array
    # use the 2 pointer technique:
    # init one pointer at the start of the array
    # init another pointer at the end of the array
    # would we ever allow the two pointers to pass each other?
    # if the pointers pass each other, then we'd just be considering
    # two values we've already looked at; we shouldn't see a new combo
    # by having the pointers pass each other
    # break out of the loop if the pointers pass each other
    # there's no two numbers that sum up to v
    # if sum of both pointers == v
        # return
    # check if the sum of both pointers == v
        # if the sum of both pointers < v
            # then that means we need a larger sum
            # increment the left pointer
        # if the sum of both pointers > v
            # then that means we need a smaller sum
            # decrement the right pointer
