We define an hourglass in  to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in 's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g
There are  hourglasses in , and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in , then print the maximum hourglass sum.

For example, given the 2D array:
