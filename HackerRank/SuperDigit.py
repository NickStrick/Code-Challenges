​
# possible base case:
# 1. if k <= 0 return 0
# 2. if P <= 9 (i.e. P is a single digit)
# 3. check the length of P, but we'd have to transform P into either
# a string or an array, since we can't take the length of a number
​
# repeat this k times: sum the digits of n
# recurse so long as P > 9 as a way to check if P has more than 1 digit
# if we recurse, then call the function with the sum from the previous
# recursion with k = 1
# in any recursive calls, k will always be 1
​
# construct our p
# note that it's a string here
​
# if len(n) == 1 and k == 1:
#   return int(n)

# call our sum_digits function
# this will update p to be an integer
# p = sum_digits(p)

# use the same function signature
# if we aren't in the base case, then P > 9
# sum the digits together
# how should we sum the digits together?
