// This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

// Given a set of characters C and an integer k, 
// a De Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every 
// possible k-length string of characters in C occurs exactly once.

// For example, suppose C = {0, 1} and k = 3. 
// Then our sequence should contain the substrings 
// {'000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111'}, 
// and one possible solution would be 00010111.

// Create an algorithm that finds a De Bruijn sequence.
function deBrujin(C, k){
    //plan
    // have a look that creates a queue,stack,dictinary
    // that can be used to create the solution

}

console.log([0,1], 3)
