// This problem was asked by Dropbox.

// Given an undirected graph G, check whether it is bipartite. 
// Recall that a graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided 
// into two independent sets, U and V, such that no edge connects 
// vertices of the same set.

function checkBipartite(graph){
    //plan
    // take a graph and run bipartite verticies

}

let myGraph = {};

console.log(checkBipartite(myGraph))
