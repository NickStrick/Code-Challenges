// This problem was asked by Lyft.

// Given a list of integers and a number K, 
// return which contiguous elements of the list sum to K.

// For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K is 9, 
// then it should return [2, 3, 4], since 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

function kSum(ints, k){
    //plan
    //recursively test the different intergers and their sums
    // determine which is the easiest solution of the group

}

console.log(kSum([1,2,3,4,5], 9)) // [2,3,4]
