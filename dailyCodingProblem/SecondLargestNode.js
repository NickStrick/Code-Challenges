// Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
// This problem was asked by Dropbox.

// Given the root to a binary search tree, find the second largest node in the tree.

function secondLargestNode(root){

    // if binary search tree has larger values on the right, and lesser on the left,
    //      have a pointer and root and root.right untill furthest right
            // return the node previous to largest

}

let root = {
    value: 1,
    left: null,
    right: null,
}
console.log(secondLargestNode(root))
