//  Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
 
//  This problem was asked by Google.
 
//  Given a word W and a string S, find all starting indices in S which are anagrams of W.
 
//  For example, given that W is "ab", and S is "abxaba", return 0, 3, and 4.

function anagramSearch(W, S){

    // at each indicy check if letter is in anagram
    // if is, set object and check  off what in word has been used
    //if from starting indicy, uses all letters in object, att indicy to result list

}


console.log(anagramSearch("ab", "abxaba")) // [0,3,4]
