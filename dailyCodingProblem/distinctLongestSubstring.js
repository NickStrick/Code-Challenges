// This problem was asked by Amazon.

// Given an integer k and a string s, 
// find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

// For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".

function distinctLongestSubstring(s, k){
    // understand
        // so basically at each index, count longest substring with k charaters
            // if longer then previous longest, set as longest
        // until character count is greater then k

        // return longest
}
