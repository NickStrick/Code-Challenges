// Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

// This problem was asked by Microsoft.

// Given an array of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number k. For example, given [20, 303, 3, 4, 25] and k = 49, return true as 20 + 4 + 25 = 49.


//  loop through array
// add current index to solution list
// loop through rest of list after index, 

// can we do this recursively?
//
