# reduce takes a data structure and either finds a key piece of data or
# be able to restructure the data structure

# 1. Reduce usually takes a linear data structure (99% we use reduce on an array)
# 2. Reduce "aggregates" all of the data in the data structure into one final value
# 3. Reduce is extremely flexible with how the reduction actually happens
# 3a. Reduce doesn't care how the reduction happens
# 4. The "reducer" function that's passed in as input is how we specify how the reduction happens

# what's the deal with the anonymous function's parameters?
# 1. An aggregator value
# 2. The current list node
# 3. An optional value the aggregator is initialized with

# what happens on a single call of the anonymous function?
# how many times does the reducer function get called? Once for every element in our data structure
# does the anonymous function do the work of iterating over our data structure?
# no, the anonymous function itself doesn't do the work of iterating


# Steps for our reduce function


# How do all of these calls get aggregated into a single value?
# The anonymous function needs to update the aggregated value somehow

# where is the state set and how is it defaulted to the head?

def linked_list_reduce(head, reducer, init=None):
    # where/when do we initialize the state?
    # initialize state before we start looping
    state = None
    # what do we do when the init value is set?
    if init != None:
        state = init
    # what do we do when the init value is None?
    elif state is None:
        # set the state to be the first value in our list
        state = head.value
        # move the head to the next list node
        head = head.next
    # 1. Loop over the data structure
    current = head

    while current:
        # 2. Call our anonymous function on the current iteration value
        # 3. Update our state to be the result of the anonymous function
        state = reducer(state, current.value)
        # update our current pointer
        current = current.next
    # 4. Return the final aggregated state
    return state
