def smallest_missing(arr):
    # how do we know that the first missing element is 0?
    # how do we find the sequence?
    # what's the definition of "missing"?

    # yes, the sequence will always increase by 1

    # Idea 1:
    # given that the array is already sorted, can we check if the
    # next array element == the current array element + 1?
    # if not, then we know that there's the missing element
    # looks like we can assume that 0 is always the smallest missing
    # number; if we don't see a 0 at the beginning, that's our
    # missing number

    # Idea 2a:
    # O(n)
    # Worst case is when everything is in order
    # loop through the array using array indices
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # check that each array element matches its index
        if arr[i] != i:
            # if it doesn't, return i as our smallest missing element
            return i
    # return the length of the array if we reach the end of the loop
    return len(arr)

    # What's the smallest index in the array where its value doesn't
    # match the index?
​
# Idea 2b:
# can we take advantage of the fact that the array is already
# sorted to perform this more efficiently?
# Do we need to check every single array element for us to still
# figure out the correct answer?
# We need to check every array element to make sure it matches
# its corresponding index
# Can we utilize binary search for this?
# the array needs to already be sorted
# find the midpoint of our array
