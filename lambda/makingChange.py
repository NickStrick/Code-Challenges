# 1. Realize our recursive solution is too slow
# 2. Init a cache - figure out what kind of data structure to use for our cache and what data it's actually going to hold
# 3. Create a new function that does the work of initing the cache and calling the recursiive function with the cache
# 4. Alter our recursive function to take advantage of the cache - change its signature to accept the cache, update it so that
#    it saves its answers in the cache and calls the parent function instead of itself; naive function updates the cache, parent function checks the cache
