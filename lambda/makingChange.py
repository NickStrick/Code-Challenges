# 1. Realize our recursive solution is too slow
# 2. Init a cache - figure out what kind of data structure to use for our cache and what data it's actually going to hold
# 3. Create a new function that does the work of initing the cache and calling the recursiive function with the cache
# 4. Alter our recursive function to take advantage of the cache - change its signature to accept the cache, update it so that
#    it saves its answers in the cache and calls the parent function instead of itself; naive function updates the cache, parent function checks the cache


"""
Bottom up approach that utilizes a cache a little bit differently from 
how we saw it in today's session. Here, we seed the cache with an initial
value cache[0] = 1, and then compute subsequent answers based on the initial
value we have. 
â€‹
This can be done by incrementing cache[i] += cache[i - coin] when coin <= i.
Intuitively, this is saying that the number of ways we have to make 
cache[i - coin] in change can be leveraged to make cache[i] in change.
